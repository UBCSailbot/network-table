# This script will:
# 1 Build the network table server
#   and an example client program.
# 2 Run the network table server.
# 3 Run multiple clients which will
#   communicate with the network table.
# 4 Determine how many errors occured
#   based on the return values of the clients.
#   The clients should return 0 if no
#   errors occured, otherwise return the
#   number of errors.
